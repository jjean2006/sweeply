# Sweeply

## What is Sweeply
Sweeply is a modern, end-to-end facility management platform purpose-built for hostels. It replaces intrusive door-knocking, messy group chats, and blind management with a simple, data-driven workflow that respects students’ time, empowers housekeeping staff, and gives administrators real operational visibility.

## Why are we doing this
### Hostel housekeeping today is reactive and inefficient:
- Students face unpredictable interruptions and lack a reliable way to request urgent cleaning.
- Housekeeping staff waste time on locked doors, unclear routes, and confusing chat threads—often across language barriers.
- Administrators operate without data on performance, demand, or satisfaction, making optimization guesswork.
#### Sweeply turns this chaos into clarity.
## What Sweeply Delivers
- Student Web Portal: Book slots based on staff availability, submit urgent “SOS” requests, and rate completed cleanings.
- Staff Web Portal: A minimalist, chronological task list with one-tap language switching (e.g., Tamil) for inclusive, high adoption.
- Admin Web Dashboard: Real-time oversight with analytics on efficiency, satisfaction, and demand patterns.

## Key Features
- Smart Slot Scheduling: Students select cleaning slots from pre-set staff availability.
- SOS Request Pool: Urgent requests flow into a shared queue for the nearest/available staff to claim.
- Real-Time Task Management: Start, progress, and complete statuses sync instantly across all apps.
- Feedback & Ratings: A simple, in-app quality loop after each service.
- Actionable Analytics: Track average cleaning time, staff performance, peak hours, and satisfaction trends.
- Multi-Language Support: Designed for vernacular-first usage to boost usability and accuracy.
## Impact

Sweeply moves hostel operations from reactive to proactive:
- Better student experience with predictable, respectful service.
- Higher staff productivity via clear routes and language-inclusive tools.
- Data-backed decision-making for admins—optimize staffing, identify bottlenecks, and improve quality continuously.

## Built to Scale

Sweeply’s architecture and workflows generalize beyond hostels to PGs/co-living, service apartments, and office facilities—scaling from a single building to multi-site operations with centralized analytics.
